 The shut-umbrella machine
   The eloquent tower machine
      The machine of glass & fizzled light
     The one for moon manufacture
        The fantasy tableaux
        The five-cylindered
     The one with the wire-bound animals
The poison gas and ear-popping sound machine
  The machine of tar layered below genuflective water
       The three-leaved machine
     The twin-pillared soothsaying machine
     The one to change a riverâ€™s direction
       The other that bores a hole in the ground
     The one whose top splits off to soar into the sky
      The five keys that appear as turrets
       The one that gathers
        The three-face
The machine that carries another machine inside it
       The old hundred-killer
The one that merges in the sky but transports
    elephants camels chariots on the ground
    The one made from metal found
      where stars have been sown
      The one to look for objects lost
      on or under the surface of the sea
The machine of smoke-like-dew or dew-like-smoke
                  The heat attractor
    That device that captures not only the appearance
             but also the intentions
           of whomever comes near
       The one like a bird with beak open
         The other like a mridangam with
           the volume of approx. 63 bangs
        Another an inverted earthen pot
      The one that gallops like a horse
    when set to work by its key
    The machine of the three-beaked crow
          square in shape and white in colour
            that burns trees for its oil
    The machine that ferries and releases pigs
            The one that makes timber and
              the one that makes the hands
               that haul the timber
       The eight-petaled rain-making machine
           The light-filterer The mortar
         with sieve-like holes
      The one that sets fractured bones
    The one that wraps a body in
   the bark of the valkala and severs the limbs
